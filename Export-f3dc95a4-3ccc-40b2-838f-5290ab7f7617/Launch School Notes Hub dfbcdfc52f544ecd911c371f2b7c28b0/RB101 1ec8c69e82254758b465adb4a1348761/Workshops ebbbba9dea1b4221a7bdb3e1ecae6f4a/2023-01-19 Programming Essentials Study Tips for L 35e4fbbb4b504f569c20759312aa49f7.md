# Programming Essentials: Study Tips for LS

### What Should you expect?

- Anything less than an A is met with a “conditional pass” or “not yet”
    - over-prepare for the assessments
    - if you get like a 90% that’s the tipping point
- Study guides are good at outline topics in the exams
    - exams are on your schedule
- Resources
    - post in slack channels
    - community is there to help you
- Topics build on top of each other
- Role of the exams are natural road blocks

### Study Goals

- don’t set outcome oriented goals think process-oriented instead

### Successful study session look like?

- make sure study space is consistent and not distracting
    - dedicated to study
- find out if you are a silence or music study person
    - no podcasts or TV
- timing self while you study to keep accountable
    - and take breaks whether pre-determined or not
    - pomodoro technique 25mins focus study then break for 5-15mins
        - can do blocks of 4 25mins sections
        - can be longer study intervals and break
        - make sure there’s a dif btwn break and study
- Maybe sometimes need to switch from reading to practical learning problems

### Specific study techniques

- building and understanding
    - reading the text and watching the videos
    - asking questions or discussing the concepts with someone
    - making flashcards
    - writing summaries of the material summaries what you read
    - drawing an idea web
        - might not always work for every topic
- repeated exposure and practice
    - using the flashcards you made
    - reading own summaries
    - writing mini-articles about topics on the study guide
        - study guide end of each course
    - completing the practice problems
    - coding in front of someone else
- active recall and elaboration
    - quizzes
    - do more than what you just learned take it further
    - giving impromptu “lectures” even without someone listening
        - open up random lesson
        - click on rand assignment
        - then sit there and out loud with/out looking at material give an impromptu lecture into the abyss
    - coming up with your own analogies and examples
    - write your own exam questions and practice problems
    - teach the concepts to someone else
- extra notes
    - learning is not linear
    - there is a lot of overlapping in these techniques
    - and don’t use all of these just what works for you maybe at least one from each category
    - Trevor’s personal approach
        - Three passes through the material
        - 1st go through the lesson
            - then take the quiz and bomb out
        - 2nd pass divide things up by assignment
            - read assignment
            - then write long form summary of assignment
            - then create own practice problems
        - Then go through study guide
            - summarize in long form study guide
            - then one more pass read through everything
            - 3rd attempt on quiz should be easy 100% at this point
        - Then for final exam go through study guide
        - Does 3-4 blocks of 4 25mins focus study with 10min breaks inbtwn
        - Other suggestions from students
            - Anki flashcards
            - Scribing notes and then reviewing shortly after writing them

### Are you assessment ready?

- Checklist:
    - Have you read all the material more than once ALL of these materials
    - Have you answered all the practice problems at least once?
        - Going back to practice these problems multiple times
        - Got right answer but think codes messy or could be improved do those over before the exam
    - Have you practiced summarizing the material in your own words?
    - Have you gotten 100% on every quiz now?
    - Can you confidently discuss every topic on the study guide?
    - Have you gone through the material a final time and not learned anything new?
        - can build confidence
    - For interviews: Have you practiced answering coding questions in front of people?

### Tips!

- Have the appropriate expectations
- Trust the curriculum and focus on the material provided
- Set process-oriented goals for yourself
    - Come up with list of successful behaviors
- Set yourself up for success with focused study sessions
- Find the study techniques that work for you
- Take advantage of the resources that LS provides
    - Study sessions
    - Code review
- Over-prepare for the exams and don’t rush
- Have fun

### Q&A

- If you get 2 “Not Yet’s” on an exam you will get a phone call to discuss what’s going on. You can be kicked out of core for getting too many not yet’s on a case by case basis. If you do poorly on the exams and get too many not yet’s means you wont get into capstone.
- Set a specific schedule at least 3days/week
- During written exams you can consult documentation during interview exams you
- Not Yet score two weeks wait time at least 1 week for certain circumstances
- #new_student_study_group study group from Sedonia Steininger
- “Higher ups” need constant confirmation what’s okay what’s not
- code wars and leetcode for practice
- Mediate before every interview
- Quizzes are for you don’t count as assessments at all especially if you are doing well on assessments and following code of conduct
- Do one block first thing in the morning
- How much does TA position pay at LS: won’t answer talk to people when you are at that point and want to be a TA
- All assessments are on CoderPad
- 1200/1800 hours for Core curriculum there is medium article
- Did CS50 not as good as LS
